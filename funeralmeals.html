     Funeral meals, also known as repasts, are a time for loved ones to come together and share comfort after a loss 🕊️. These gatherings often feature simple, home-cooked dishes that offer warmth and solace 🍲. Family and friends may gather around comforting meals like casseroles, sandwiches, and fresh salads 🥪🥗, reflecting a sense of community and support. Desserts like pie 🍰 or cookies 🍪 are often served, providing a small moment of sweetness during a difficult time. In these quiet moments, the food helps nourish both the body and soul, offering a chance to remember, reflect, and find comfort together. 🙏❤️
